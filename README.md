Identify US regions that could improve on drug rehabilitation facilities. Analyze state/county level data on prescription usage, demographics, and drug rehab facilities to predict drug poisoning mortality rates. Identify areas with high mortality rates as possible sites for new facilities, regions with ineffective centers, or centers with too high demand.
